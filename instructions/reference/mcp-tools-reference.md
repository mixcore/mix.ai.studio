# Mix MCP Lib: Enhanced Agentic MCP Server

## ðŸ¤– MIX AI AGENT CRITICAL PROTOCOL
**You are a Mix AI Agent** - Before using any MCP tools:

1. **Check MCP Server Support** - Verify the task can be handled by Mix.Mcp.Services
2. **Use MCP Tools First** - Primary interface for all Mix CMS operations
3. **Maintain Agent Identity** - Stay in Mix AI Agent character
4. **Document MCP Usage** - Record tools used and effectiveness
5. **Agent-First Approach** - Leverage agentic capabilities of the MCP server

## Architecture Overview

The Mix MCP Lib implements an advanced agentic server architecture for handling user requests, planning, task execution, and conversational interactions. The system is modular, extensible, and leverages both LLMs (Large Language Models) and structured tool execution via the MCP protocol.

**As a Mix AI Agent, you are designed to work seamlessly with this agentic architecture.**

## Key Agent Classes

### RoutingAgent
- **Role:** Entry point for user requests. Classifies intent (chat vs. plan) using LLM and routes to the appropriate agent.
- **Logic:**
  - Uses LLM to classify user input as either a normal conversation or a planning/multi-step request
  - Delegates to ChatAgent or PlanningAgent accordingly
  - **Enhanced:** Now supports knowledge base integration for better intent classification

### PlanningAgent
- **Role:** Handles multi-step/planning requests with enhanced knowledge integration.
- **Logic:**
  - Uses LLM to break down user input into actionable prompts, considering available MCP tools
  - **Enhanced:** Queries knowledge base for relevant context before planning
  - Executes each prompt sequentially via TaskAgent, passing context/results between steps
  - Publishes progress/results via MQTT
  - Returns a summary of the plan execution

### TaskAgent
- **Role:** Executes individual tasks, including direct tool invocation and command handling.
- **Logic:**
  - Analyzes input to determine if it maps to an MCP tool or a command (start, status, complete, etc.)
  - If a tool is identified, calls the MCP tool and logs the result
  - Maintains task state and history with enhanced memory management
  - **Enhanced:** Can access knowledge base for better tool selection
  - Falls back to LLM for general responses if no tool/command matches

### ChatAgent
- **Role:** Handles conversational (non-planning) interactions with knowledge integration.
- **Logic:**
  - Maintains conversation history
  - **Enhanced:** Can search knowledge base for relevant information
  - Builds prompts for LLM based on conversation context
  - Returns LLM-generated responses

## Enhanced MCP Tools

### SemanticSearchTool
- **SearchAsync:** Performs semantic search with configurable similarity thresholds
- **FindSimilarAsync:** Finds documents similar to provided text
- **IndexDocumentAsync:** Adds new documents to the search index
- **Features:** JSON-formatted responses, error handling, parameter validation

### ClassStructureTool
- **GetClassStructure:** Returns the structure of any class by its full name
- **Features:** JSON output includes properties, methods, and attributes for agentic usage
- **Use Case:** Enables agents and users to understand and interact with any class in the system

### Knowledge-Enhanced Planning
- Agents now leverage knowledge base for better context understanding
- Planning decisions include relevant documentation and best practices
- Improved tool selection based on historical knowledge and patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Service Registration// Enhanced service registration in AgentExtensions.cs
builder.Services.TryAddSingleton<IKnowledgeBaseService, KnowledgeBaseService>();
builder.Services.TryAddSingleton<ISemanticSearchService, SemanticSearchService>();
builder.Services.TryAddSingleton<IResourceCacheService, ResourceCacheService>();
### Knowledge Base Usage// Agents automatically get knowledge context
var context = await GetKnowledgeContextAsync(userInput, "planning");

// Search for specific information
var knowledge = await SearchKnowledgeAsync("database operations", 5);
### Semantic Search via MCP// Via MCP tool
var results = await semanticSearchTool.SearchAsync("content management", 10, 0.7);

// Direct service usage
var similar = await semanticSearchService.FindSimilarAsync(documentContent, 5);
### Resource Caching// Get or create with factory
var expensiveData = await cacheService.GetOrCreateAsync(
    "expensive_computation", 
    async ct => await ComputeExpensiveData(ct),
    TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30));
