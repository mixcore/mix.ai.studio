Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. **Project Structure**: Understand the overall structure of the project, including key directories and files. This will help in navigating the codebase and making informed changes.

2. **Coding Standards**: Follow established coding standards and best practices for the specific programming languages and frameworks used in the project. This includes naming conventions, file organization, and code formatting.

3. **Documentation**: Refer to existing documentation for guidance on using project components, APIs, and workflows. If documentation is lacking, consider creating or updating it as part of your changes.

4. **Testing**: Write tests for new features and ensure existing tests pass before submitting changes. This helps maintain code quality and prevents regressions.

5. **Collaboration**: Communicate with team members and seek feedback on your changes. Use version control effectively to manage code changes and collaborate with others.

6. **Security**: Be mindful of security implications when making changes, especially in areas like authentication, authorization, and data handling.

7. **Performance**: Consider the performance impact of your changes, particularly in critical code paths. Optimize for efficiency where necessary.

8. **Accessibility**: Ensure that new features and changes are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Follow best practices for web accessibility (e.g., WCAG).

9. **User Experience**: Keep the end-user in mind when making changes. Aim for a seamless and intuitive user experience across the application.

10. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated on industry trends, tools, and best practices. Continuously seek to improve your skills and knowledge.

By following these guidelines, you can contribute effectively to the project and help maintain a high standard of quality.
